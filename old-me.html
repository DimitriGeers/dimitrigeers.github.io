        <h1><u>The road to chocolate Valhalla:</u></h1>
        <p>
          Eight years ago I started as a temporary worker at Fuji Oil Europe, a food processing
          plant that processes plant-based fats and produces chocolate compounds. After going from a temporary position
          to a permanent one, I quickly rose trough the ranks in the chocolate-compound division and made team-lead within
          a year.
        </p>
        <p>
          After several years of shift-work and a plethora of technical training I was able to apply for a position on the
          production-management team. 5 years after first entering the building, I was made "System Manager" and was able to
          streamline the production administration and traceability, removed most of the digital problems faced by the other managers and
          reduced the workload for our planner by automating most of his work.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the production planner was let go, I took over his job and was acting planner for a year. Still being in love with
          all things digital, but unable to combine my two jobs, I chose to leave the company for a new career.

        <p>
          Now i'm ready to plunge into the world of IT as a functional Analyst, with the help of Switchfully.
