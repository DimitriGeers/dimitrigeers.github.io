          <p>
            There are many ways to obscure messages and other data. In our history we've seen many techniques to keep our
            data safe from prying eyes. Currently, our passwords are kept safe by quasi-unbreakable algorithms and itelligently distributed keys that would
            take a quantum computer to break (within a reasonable amount of time) or a group of regular computers several lifetimes to crack.
          </p>
          <p> An early form of encryption was the <em>"Caesar Cipher"</em>, which shifted the original characters by a secretly agreed upon amount of steps in the alphabet.
          </p>

              <img src='images/Caesar-cipher.svg' width="28%" height="75%" style='float: Left; padding:5px;'/>
              <p>
                This image shows how all letters can be substituted by shifting them to the left. Although this
                is not very hard to crack, given some time.
                <br>
                newer ciphers increased their security, for example, by also adding letter-combinations to the character-set.
                This increases the 26-letter alphabet to 676 letters. Given enough computing power and linguistic analysis, even <em>this</em>
                cipher is crack-able if you don't include a pre-shared, random key.

              At this time, a simple cipher would not be sufficient to keep your data secure. Brilliant minds
              in the field of mathematics, engineering and computer science have come up with some truly amazing algorithms and systems
              to make sure no-one (save a few brilliant crackers) can access your private messages.

              Here are some commonly used ones:
              <ul>
                <li>3DES - Used by companies like Microsoft and Mozilla</li>
                <li>RSA - Used for SSH authentication and SSL-encryption</li>
                <li>AES - Algorithm by Belgian design, easily implemented in hardware and restricted enviroments</li>
                <li>Blowfish - Free-to-use algorithm that is popular in crypto-software</li>
                <li>Twofish - for low resource devices, such as SIM-cards</li>
              </ul>
