              My name is Dimitri and I'm a 31 year old nerd with an akward sense of humor and insatiable
              hunger to know how things work. I've been tinkering with computers ever since I was old enough to handle a screwdriver.
              I'll make useless devices with various microcontrollers just for the fun of it. At this point in my tinkerer's quest I've broken
              as much things as i've fixed, but i'm definitely working on getting that ratio fixed. My other hobbies (that have little-to-no chance of me getting electrical shocks)
              are playing the guitar or piano and singing along with both. I'm not particularly skilled at it, but it provides me with a great release from the hustle and bustle of my job.

          <h1>Humble dwelling: </h1>
            <p>
              The place where I can find the most peace is located in the rural town of 'Wachtebeke'.
              It's located near the dutch border and boasts a whopping population of 7.5k. It's mostly known for
              for "Puyenbroeck" - A 5.2kmÂ² recreational park.
              My wife and I live in a cozy apartment in the center of this bustling village with our 2 cats.

            I'm blessed to have found someone that is as nerdy as I am ... my wife!
            <br>
            Currently, she's a software engineer at  <b>-REDACTED-</b>, widely known for their national healthcare service and the fact that they
            supply software solutions to our healthcare workers all across the country.
            We are both completely in love with the snowy north and we take every chance we get to enjoy the solitude of the swedish or norwegian polar regions.
